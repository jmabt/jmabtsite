        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Heya. I'm Joe, and I am a student studying CS/CE and robotics. I attend the University at Buffalo, where I am entering my third year of college.  </p>
        <p> I'm hugely into robotics, AI and computers - have been since I was young. </p>

        <h2>Website info:</h2>
        <p> Written using HTML and CSS, so it's fast across all modern platforms and I don't have to worry about weird scaling. Might not look good, but as the old adage goes, "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." This may be an antiquated argument, and you're probably right! Modern tech is rippin fast when it comes to running webpages. Really, I'm just lazy, and I really like having a stripped-back easy to use and modify website. With no tracking whatsoever. Typeface is Liberation Serif, which is one of my personal favorite typefaces. </p>
